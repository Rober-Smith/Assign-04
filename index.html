    <h2 class="info">History</h2>
    <p class="background">Charles Babage was born on the 26 of December 1791.Charles was the son of a banker and was mainly homeschooled.He was interested in mathematics by the time he went to Cambridge University in 1810.</p>
    <h2 class="info">Achievements</h2>
    <p class="background">In, 1812,Babbage Helped founded the Analytical Society,a group of people that brought developments from european continent into english mathematics. He also contributed to the founding of the Royal Astronomical (1820) and the Statistical Societies (1834).</p>

    <h2 class="info">The difference Machine</h2>
    <p class="background">In 1823, Babbage got financial support from the government to design a device called the Difference machine to solve  equations in a matter of seconds.<br>The machine operates by toothed wheels from 0 to 9.When the toothed wheels turned from nine to zero, it causes the wheel to carry the number to the higher position.The machine had a storage to store data, just like modern computers.<br>Unfortunately, all construction came to a halt in 1833.</p>
    <h2 class="info">Legacy</h2>
    <p class="background">Although Babbage failed to construct the difference machine, his concept revolutionized the idea of a computer that we see today.</p>
